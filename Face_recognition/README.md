# Automatic Face Detection and Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to explore and implement automatic face detection and recognition techniques within images and video streams. It utilizes both classical and modern deep learning approaches, specifically the Viola-Jones algorithm and Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN), for face detection. Additionally, it employs the VGGFace model for extracting facial features to enable face re-identification.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Implements the Viola-Jones algorithm and MTCNN for detecting faces in static images and video streams.
- **Face Annotation**: Provides tools for manually annotating faces in images.
- **Face Re-identification**: Utilizes feature extraction via the VGGFace model to identify faces across different images.
- **Evaluation**: Compares detected faces against ground truth data to evaluate performance.
